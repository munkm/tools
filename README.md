Repository with tools that I use to make my computer better. 

Also cat stuff. 

Folder descriptions:

* **env** holds environment config files for my current machine, missing any
  identifying or personal information. 
* **vim** holds the vim config files for my current machine.
* **misc** holds miscellaneous interesting scripts and files that I like. 



  note: most of the vim config files have been sourced from Seth Johnson's repo
  at https://github.com/sethrj/SRJ-Vim-Resources
